# Content
This repository contains some of my projects created for computer science classes at Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology, Warsaw University of Technology.

# List of projects
This list contains names of folders with short description. More specific information about each project can be found in README file inside each directory.
## minix
Three projects implemented in the Minix operating system kernel in C involving:
- adding a new system call
- changing a process scheduler algorithm (adding new priorities to user-level processes)
- changing a memory allocation algorithm (from First Fit to Worst Fit with debugging tools)
## monitors
Extended producer - consumer problem in C++ using a monitor synchronization construct with threads.
## semaphores
Extended producer - consumer problem in C using a System V semaphore synchronization construct with processes.
## virtual-drive
A file system simulation based on chain allocation in C++.
## data-structures
Four data structures implemented in C++ with templates and iterators:
- Vector
- LinkedList
- TreeMap (using redâ€“black tree)
- HashMap
## wide-bridges
A tool for finding so-called wide bridges in an undirected graph structure.
## image-scaling
Image scaling with the bilinear interpolation algorithm implemented in:
- MIPS assembly language
- NASM assembly language with SSE
